# Rust Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer implemented in Rust, designed to help you manage your work sessions effectively using the Pomodoro Technique.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros," named after the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

## How to Use

1. **Download/Build the Project**: Clone the repository and build the project using Rust's package manager Cargo.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/trist4nl3/rust-pomodoro-webapp.git
   cd rust-pomodoro-timer
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Run the Timer**: Execute the built binary to start the Pomodoro Timer.

   ```
   ./target/release/rust-pomodoro-timer
   ```

3. **Interact with the Timer**: Once the timer starts, you'll see notifications for work sessions and breaks. Use these intervals to focus on your tasks during work sessions and take short breaks during breaks.

## Features (planned)

- [ ] **Pause/Resume Functionality**: Allow users to pause and resume the timer.
- [ ] **Customizable Work/Break Intervals**: Enable users to customize the length of work sessions and breaks.
- [ ] **Notifications**: Provide optional notifications to alert users when sessions or breaks start and end.
- [ ] **Logging**: Implement logging functionality to track productivity over time.
- [ ] **User Interface**: Develop a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- [ ] **Task Management Integration**: Integrate with task management tools or services for a seamless workflow.
